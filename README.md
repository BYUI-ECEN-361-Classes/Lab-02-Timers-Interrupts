# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-02
## BYU-I  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

## Overview / Purpose
This lab has three key learning activities.  They are to help the student understand timers, their clocking sources, and uses for applications.

All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the WORD document in your cloned repo: 

>``./Documentation/ECEN-361-Lab-02--STM32 Clocks, Timers, and Interrupts.docx``

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github.   The commit will upload this word document as well and serves as the lab submission.   (Note:  MSWord is assumed to be available.  IF you don't have MSWord to edit this document, talk with the professor or T/A.)

The final part of the assignment is to paste the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
