# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-02
## BYU-I  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

## Overview / Purpose
This lab has three key learning activities.  They are to help the student understand timers, their clocking sources, and uses for applications.

All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions HERE.

Open and follow the instructions found here. [ECEN-361-Lab-02.DOCX](./Documentation/ECEN-361-Lab-02--STM32%20Clocks,%20Timers,%20and%20Interrupts.docx).   Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github.   The commit will upload this word document as well and serves as the lab submission.   (Note:  MSWord is assumed to be available.  IF you don't have MSWord to edit this document, talk with the professor or T/A.)

The final part of the assignment is to paste the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
